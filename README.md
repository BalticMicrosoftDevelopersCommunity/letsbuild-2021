# letsbuild-2021

Repository for *Let's build 2021* support materials.

The *Let's build 2021* event contains eight sessions:

1. Introduction. Business use case, architecture & tooling, Git​
2. MVC and frontend development ​
3. Entity Framework Core & Database​
4. Testing & Dependency injection​
5. Deployment and hosting on Azure​
6. Azure Functions​
7. Cognitive services/Other integration services​
8. Closing event & final demos​

## ASP.NET development
Sessions 2, 3, and 4 are dedicated to basic principles of ASP.NET development.

The goal of these sessions is to build an ASP.NET MVC Core application, demonstrating basic approaches and practices:
* how to create an ASP.NET MVC Core application
* basic components of the  ASP.NET MVC application
* how to create and deploy a database
* how to work with the database using Entity Framework Core
* how to use JavaScript and jQuery
* what is a Blazor
* how to write unit tests
* what is a Bootstrap and how to use it.

The MVC application will be created incrementaly - step by step, where each step is illustrated by a separate Lab. We will start with almost an empty MVC application (*Lab01*). Then, we'll be adding new functions, increasing complexity and improving design. Participants will be able to take any lab from the Git repository, and reproduce demonstrated functionality.

This MVC application is a simple web-based frontend of a database, containing persons records. We will show how to add persons to the database, search resords, and display them. Then, we will show how to improve appearance of the application, using CSS, Bootstrap, and Bootstrap themes. And, finally, the application will be deployed to Azure Cloud.

This is a roadmap of these three sessions:
