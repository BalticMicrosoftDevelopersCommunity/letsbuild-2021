# letsbuild-2021

Repository for *Let's build 2021* support materials.

The *Let's build 2021* event contains eight sessions:

1. Introduction. Business use case, architecture & tooling, Git​
2. MVC and frontend development ​
3. EntityFramework Core & Database​
4. Testing & Dependency injection​
5. Deployment and hosting on Azure​
6. Azure Functions​
7. Cognitive services/Other integration services​
8. Closing event & final demos​

The goal of the Sessions 2, 3, and 4 is to build an ASP.NET MVC Core application, demonstrating basic approaches and practices. The MVC application will be created incrementaly - step by step, where each step is illustrated by a separate Lab. We will start with an empty MVC application doing almost nothing. Then, we'll be adding new functions, increasing complexity and improving design. Participants will be able to take any lab and reproduce demonstrated functionality.

This MVC application is a simple web-based frontend of a database, containing persons records. We will show how to add persons to the database, search, and display them. Then, we will show how to improve appearance of the application, using CSS, Bootstrap, and Bootstrap themes. And, finally, the application will be deployed to Azure Cloud.

This is a roadmap of these first three sessions:
