# Lab15

Demonstrates how to apply a Bootswatch theme.

Downloaded `bootstrap.min.css` from the *bootswatch.com* site for the *Superhero* theme, and placed into the `\wwwroot\css` folder.

Updated `_Layout.cshtml` - changed line:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

Modified index page to demonstrate grids and cards. Modified *Persons* page to demonstrate table style and pagination, using applied theme.
