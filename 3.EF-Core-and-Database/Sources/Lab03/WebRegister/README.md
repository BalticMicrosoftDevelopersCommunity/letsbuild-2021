# Lab03

**WebReg.Database** project was added to the solution. This is a SQL Server Database project, which can be used to publish our database to UAT, production or other environments.

Initally, we created a SQL database **WebRegDb** in a local SQLEXPRESS server. Then, we created a single table *Persons* with required schema. The last step was to create the database project, importing database schema from the existing databse as `.sql` scripts.

We created a `Scripts\TestData` folder, and copied the `Persons.sql` file, generated by the *TestDataGenerator*, into it.

`Script.PostDeployment.sql` script was added to populate the database with test data.

Create *WebRegDb* database in your local SQLEXPRESS server (if it was not created before), and use it as a *Target database* for publishing.

## Points of Interest
Check that the `Scripts\TestData\Persons.sql` file has *Build Action* property set to *None*.
