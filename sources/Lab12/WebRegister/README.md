Demonstrates how to add records to the database using EF Core.

Updated `PersonService.cs` - added methods `AddPersonAsync()` and `GetPersonAsync()`.

Updated `HomeController` - modified `AddPersonForm()` and added `Person()` methods to display added person.

Added `Person.cshtml` view to the `Views\Home` folder.

Run the application, click on the *Add Person* link and add a person.
