# Lab02

**TestDataGenerator** project was added to the solution into the `tools` folder. This a console application, used to generate some test data.

The `names.txt` contains some names, generated by a random name generator.

Run the application and open the `bin\Debug\net5.0` folder. There should appear a `Persons.sql` file, containing SQL statements, inserting test data into a database. We will need this file later.

## Points of Interest
Check that the `names.txt` file has *Copy to Output Directory* property set to *Copy always*.

Check that the `Persons.sql` has some *NULL* values, which make the test data more realistic.
